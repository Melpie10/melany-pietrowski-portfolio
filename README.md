# melany-pietrowski-portfolio

Melany Pietrowski's Portfolio was created when she needed to create a place where future employers could see all her information and projects in a creative and organized place. 

## Description 

VS Code was used to write the website's code. 

One of the challenges for this project was to really decide what was needed to be included, what not, and how to display it in a creative way. 

## Access

The website can be accessed from Github repository:

https://github.com/Melpie10/Horiseon-Refractor-Challenge-.git

It can also be accessed on the live website: https://melpie10.github.io/Horiseon-Refractor-Challenge-/

 ## Visuals

The website looks like this when opened on Google Chrome:

The title is now displayed in the tabs:
